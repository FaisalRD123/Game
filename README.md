## Accessibility

For evaluation, I used WAVW WebAIM web accessibility evaluation tool. As seen in the screenshots, no error found in any of the pages. I tried to evaluate all three pages separately but they all give the same result, presumably, it is checking the full website.

Deployment
The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps to deploy are as follows:
* In the GitHub repository, go to the Settings tab.
* In the Generals section, go to Pages.
* Source: deploy from branch. The branch should be main and folder was root.
* Go to codes, on the right side, click GitHub-pages.

Future Work

For the future work, a lot of new games can be added to the site. For now, there are only 2 while hundreds of thousands of different games that can be innovated with new features are available on the internet that can be deployed on this site. Also, for the manga lovers, a manga page can be created where a lot of manga can be deployed for the users to enjoy. 
Animations made the website quite slow. Better implementation of animations will work wonders on the site.
